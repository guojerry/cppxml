There is a project "gcc-xml" which based on gcc(bison), and as well-known, the code generated by Lex/Yacc is not easy to read and modify, and it is totally different for ANTLR. I try to use the ANTLR build an cpp-xml project.
I also provide a way to integrate with VS2008, you can easily extend it with simple interface to do static code check or generate code on your behalf.
